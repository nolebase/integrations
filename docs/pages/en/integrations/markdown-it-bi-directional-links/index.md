## Introduction

**Bi-directional links** (also known as internal links), and another concept you may know and hear about [WikiLinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link), holds a important place in the document engineering area. It is usually used to quickly establish a connection (or link) from one page to another page, and widely used in Wiki pages such as [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org), and now days popular tools such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).

This plugin is a fully featured compatible implementation version of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)'s [internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links), it follows two rules:

1. A page's file name (without extension) can be used as a link target, for example: `[[Bi-directional Links Example Page]]` will be parsed as a link to the globally unique `Bi-directional Links Example Page.md` file.
2. A link target can be an absolute path, for example: `[[Some Folder/Bi-directional Links Example Page]]` will be parsed as a link to `Some Folder/Bi-directional Links Example Page.md`, usually appears when you have multiple files with the same name.

### Examples

#### Basic

```markdown
[[Target Page File Name]]
```

##### Change color

```markdown
[[Target Page File Name]]{style="color: red;"}
```

### Integrate with VitePress

In the VitePress configuration file (usually `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`, the file path and extension may be different), import `@nolebase/markdown-it-bi-directional-links` as a plugin, and use it as a `markdown-it` plugin in the `markdown` option:

<!--@include: @/pages/en/snippets/details-colored-diff.md-->

```typescript
import process from 'node:process' // [!code ++]
import { defineConfigWithTheme } from 'vitepress'
import { MarkdownItBiDirectionalLinks } from '@nolebase/markdown-it-bi-directional-links' // [!code ++]

export default defineConfigWithTheme({
  lang: 'en',
  title: 'Site name', // For reference only, please do not copy directly
  description: 'Description', // For reference only, please do not copy directly
  themeConfig: {
    // Other configurations...
  },
  markdown: {
    config: (md) => {
      md.use(MarkdownItBiDirectionalLinks({ // [!code ++]
        dir: process.cwd(), // [!code ++]
      })) // [!code ++]
    },
  },
})
```

### Integrate on-demand

<!--@include: @/pages/en/snippets/configure-on-your-own-warning.md-->

Import this plugin into the file where you can access the [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) instance, and use it as a `markdown-it` plugin:

```typescript
import { MarkdownItBiDirectionalLinks } from '@nolebase/markdown-it-bi-directional-links' // [!code ++]
```

Then you need to use the `use()` member methods from the `markdown-it` instance to use this plugin.
With a options object that contains a `dir` field which is the root directory of your project supplied, the value for `dir` field can be obtained through `cwd()` function call that imported from either `process` or `node:process`:

```typescript
import MarkdownItBiDirectionalLinks from '@nolebase/markdown-it-bi-directional-links'
import { cwd } from 'process' // [!code ++]

// Rest of the code...

markdownIt.use(MarkdownItBiDirectionalLinks({ // [!code ++]
  dir: process.cwd() // [!code ++]
})) // [!code ++]
```
