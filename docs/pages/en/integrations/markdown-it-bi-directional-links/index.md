# Bi-directional Links <Badge type="tip" text="v1.28.0" />

**Bi-directional links** (also known as internal links), and another concept you may know and hear about [WikiLinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link), holds a important place in the document engineering area. It is usually used to quickly establish a connection (or link) from one page to another page, and widely used in Wiki pages such as [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org), and now days popular tools such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).

This plugin is a fully featured compatible implementation version of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)'s [internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links), it follows two rules:

1. A page's file name (without extension) can be used as a link target, for example: `[[Bi-directional Links Example Page]]` will be parsed as a link to the globally unique `Bi-directional Links Example Page.md` file.
2. A link target can be an absolute path, for example: `[[Some Folder/Bi-directional Links Example Page]]` will be parsed as a link to `Some Folder/Bi-directional Links Example Page.md`, usually appears when you have multiple files with the same name.
