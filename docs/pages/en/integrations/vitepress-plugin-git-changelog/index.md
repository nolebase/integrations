# Git-based page histories <Badge type="tip" text="v1.28.0" />

## Why

Just like what [VueUse documentations site](https://vueuse.org/core/useStorage/#contributors) has, wouldn't a Git-based page histories be a great feature for your VitePress site?

> Documentations engineering is a process of continuous improvement.

Most advanced content management systems, like those used by operating systems and knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, Notion, Confluence, Outline), track the timestamp of the last edit on files and pages. Documenting the evolution of your content is crucialâ€”it informs users of the most recent updates and identifies the contributors responsible for those changes. Including a changelog and a list of contributors is essential for transparency and acknowledgment.

Enter the `@nolebase/vitepress-plugin-git-changelog` plugin. It's a tool that generates changelogs and contributor lists, seamlessly integrating them into your VitePress site.

It harnesses the robust capabilities of gitâ€”a staple for developers, technical writers, and documentation specialistsâ€”to maintain a comprehensive log of revisions.

No need to setup and pay for additional databases, preparing operating systems, or subscribe to online services. **Git logs are all you need.**
