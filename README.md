# [Nólëbase](https://github.com/nolebase/nolebase) Integrations

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

---

A collection of diverse documentation engineering tools.

> [Nólëbase](https://github.com/nolebase/nolebase) is an open-source knowledge base named after Nólëbase, pronounced as nole-base, derived from the Quenya word 'nólë' meaning 'knowledge' and the English word 'base', hence 'knowledge base'.

## Features

- 🚀 Documentation Engineering First
  - From the perspective of documentation engineering, solve and simplify some UX/DX problems, aiming to let creators focus on writing documents, notes, making cards and GTD!
- ⚖️ Compatible and Easy to Use
  - Whether it is static-first like VitePress, or client-first like Obsidian, the "Nólëbase Integrations" project hopes to provide a similar or even better experience across different platforms.
- 🧩 Rich Features
  - Each platform has its own advantages and missing features, but the documentation engineering is already time-consuming and labor-intensive. These issues should not be obstacles to restrict the writing and sharing of documents and knowledge. Expand your imagination far beyond with Nólëbase Integrations.

## Get started

- [Documentation](https://nolebase-integrations.ayaka.io/): It's not easy to demonstrate how integrations work with VitePress, and navigate to find references in README, why don't we give it a try to use our documentation site generated by VitePress?
- [packages](./packages) directory: All the integrations are kept under the `packages` directory, and each integration is a separate package. You can find the corresponding README in each package directory for more details.

If you just want to use the integrations, you can use the following command to install the integrations you need into your VitePress project:

```shell
pnpm i @nolebase/<integration-name> -D
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
ni @nolebase/<integration-name> -D
```

To find out the integration name, there is a list of integrations below.

- [UnoCSS (for Obsidian)](https://github.com/nolebase/obsidian-plugin-unocss)
- [Bi-Directional Links (for `markdown-it`)](./packages/markdown-it-bi-directional-links/README.md)
- [Elements Transformation (for `markdown-it`)](./packages/markdown-it-element-transform/README.md)
- [Enhanced Readabilities (for VitePress)](./packages/vitepress-plugin-enhanced-readabilities/README.md)
- [Changelog & File history (for VitePress)](./packages/vitepress-plugin-git-changelog/README.md)
- [Inline Link Previewing (for VitePress)](./packages/vitepress-plugin-inline-link-preview/README.md)
- [Blinking highlight targeted heading (for VitePress)](./packages/vitepress-plugin-highlight-targeted-heading/README.md)

## How to develop

The project uses [`unbuild`](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) and [`vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) to develop and build. With the powerful features offered from [`jiti`](https://github.com/unjs/jiti), we no longer need to use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for tedious configuration and then watch the local file changes and bundle the modified and developed the modules without [`vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for hot-reload. We can directly run the following command to output the bundled file and get started on development:

```shell
pnpm run packages:stub
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr packages:stub
```

Next, you need to start the the documentation site (with VitePress) for previewing and development. You can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm run docs:dev
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr docs:dev
```

## How to build

```shell
pnpm run packages:build
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr packages:build
```

To build the documentation and preview site, you can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm run docs:build
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr docs:build
```
