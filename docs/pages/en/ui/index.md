## How to use

::: tip ðŸ™‹ Before install

Currently `@nolebase/ui` is still under development, and will be used by other [Nolebase Integrations](https://nolebase-integrations.ayaka.io) components now (such as [`vitepress-plugin-git-changelog`](/pages/en/integrations/vitepress-plugin-git-changelog/)). And those components and integrations of [Nolebase Integrations](https://nolebase-integrations.ayaka.io) will configure the needed options and settings to bundle and transform the underlying dependencies.

Therefore, if you would ever want to install `@nolebase/ui` as one of your dependencies, you would need to configure a few configurations before proceeding:

#### 1. Additional configurations for Vite

##### 1.1 For users who imported `<NuLazyTeleportRiveCanvas />` component

Since `<NuLazyTeleportRiveCanvas />` depends on `@rive-app/canvas`. If you also use Vite as your bundler, you will need to add the following configurations to your `vite.config.ts` file like this:

```typescript twoslash
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    optimizeDeps: { // [!code ++]
      include: [ // [!code ++]
        // Add this line to your vite.config.ts's optimizeDeps.include array // [!code ++]
        '@nolebase/ui-rive-canvas > @rive-app/canvas', // [!code ++]
      ], // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
  }
})
```

For more information about why configure this, please refer to the [Dep Optimization Options | Vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/dep-optimization-options.html#optimizedeps-exclude) documentation.

##### 1.2 For users who imported VitePress related components

If you are using VitePress, and imported components relies on VitePress, you will need to add the following configurations to your `vite.config.ts` file like this:

```typescript twoslash
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    ssr: { // [!code ++]
      noExternal: [ // [!code ++]
        // Add this line to your vite.config.ts's ssr.noExternal array // [!code ++]
        '@nolebase/ui', // [!code ++]
      ], // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
  }
})
```

For more information about why configure this, please refer to the [Server-Side Rendering | Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html#ssr-externals) documentation.
